1. Inspiration
----------------------------------
I decided to create a new birthday reminder desktop applet
because I just could not find any birthday reminder software out there
that would also support namedays.
In my part of Europe, nameday celebrations are equally important
as birthdays (sometimes even more, because unlike for birthdays,
everyone knows when you celebrate your nameday :)

To make the plasmoid usable for the rest of the world,
the whole nameday stuff can be turned completely off.
This way you can use the plasmoid just like any other birthday reminder
that supports birthdays and anniversaries.

Internal logic of the plasmoid is inspired by the K Birthday Reminder,
while for the visualisation I learned many tricks by studying
the Public Transport.


2. Features
----------------------------------
The plasmoid shows a sorted list of coming birthdays, namedays
and anniversaries. These events are shown in a table-like view,
so you can easily select or reorder the columns you want to see.

Namedays can optionally be aggregated by name (one line standing
for all contacts that celebrate their nameday on the particular day) ->
this is especially useful for frequently used names such as Peter, etc.
Of course, individual contacts can be 'unrolled' by double-clicking
on the name entry.

Names shown for aggregated nameday entries are taken
from the selectable country-specific nameday calendar.

At the moment, contact information is taken from the KDE Address Book.
In the future I plan to add support for other sources such as Akonadi
or Mozilla Calendar.


3. Installation
----------------------------------
Unpack the tarball, go to its directory and execute
./install.sh

If the build and installation succeeds, the plasmoid should show up
in the add widgets dialog. If not, please re-login to KDE or execute:
kquitapp plasma-desktop
kstart plasma-desktop

The plasmoid can be removed by executing
./uninstall.sh

To build the plasmoid, you will need development packages for
KDE PIM, KDE4, Qt4 and cmake.
Exact package names are distribution-specific.


4. Contributions
----------------------------------
Any feedback, ideas, suggestions or contributions are highly appreciated.
Your support is especially needed for internationalization
and providing of additional nameday calendars.
