1. Inspiration
----------------------------------
I decided to create a new birthday reminder desktop applet because I just could not find
any birthday reminder software out there that would also support namedays.
In my part of Europe, nameday celebrations are equally important as birthdays
(sometimes even more, because unlike for birthdays, everyone knows when you celebrate
your nameday :)

To make the plasmoid usable for the rest of the world, the whole nameday stuff can be
turned completely off. This way you can use the plasmoid just like any other birthday
reminder that supports birthdays and anniversaries.

Internal logic of the plasmoid is inspired by the K Birthday Reminder, while for the
visualisation I learned many tricks by studying the Public Transport.


2. Features
----------------------------------
The plasmoid shows a sorted list of coming birthdays, namedays and anniversaries.
These events are shown in a table-like view, so you can easily select or reorder the
columns you want to see.

Namedays can optionally be aggregated by name (one line standing for all contacts that
celebrate their nameday on the particular day) -> this is especially useful for frequently
used names such as Peter, etc.
Of course, individual contacts can be 'unrolled' by double-clicking on the name entry.

Names shown for aggregated nameday entries are taken from the selectable country-specific
nameday calendar.

At the moment, contact information is taken from the KDE Address Book. In the future I plan
to add support for other sources such as Akonadi or Mozilla Calendar.


3. Installation
----------------------------------
Unpack the tarball, go to its directory and execute
./install.sh

If the build and installation succeeds, the plasmoid should show up in the add widgets
dialog. If not, please re-login to KDE or execute:
kquitapp plasma-desktop
kstart plasma-desktop

The plasmoid can be removed by executing
./uninstall.sh

To build the plasmoid, you will need development packages for KDE PIM, KDE4, Qt4 and cmake.
Exact package names are distribution-specific.


4. Troubleshooting
----------------------------------
KDE Address Book was significantly changed in KDE SC 4.4. Older address books located under
~/.kde4/share/apps/kabc/std.vcf should, however, be working fine.
In case that you don't use the KDE address book yet and want to create it new on KDE 4.4,
open kaddressbook and follow the steps below:
- Select File - New - Add Address Book
- Choose KDE Address Book (traditional)
- In the wizard, press Next, select File, press Next,
  accept default option with std.vcf, press Finish.
- the contacts you will be adding to this address book should appear in the plasmoid.

If you prefer namedays over anniversaries, you can insert the namedays of your contacts to
the "Anniversary" field of the address book, and set it this way in the BirthdayList
configuration dialog.

KDE address book in KDE 4.4 does not support custom fields, which may complicate the matters
if you want to use both namedays and anniversaries. You will have to edit the std.vcf file
manually.

If you want to add a custom nameday calendar, create a new text file under the data engine
installation directory, e.g. /usr/share/apps/plasma_engine_birthdaylist/namedaydefs/
with the name "namedays_<langcode>.txt, where <langcode> is replaced by your language.
The first line in this file contains a human-readable name for the language, remaining lines
contain name entries. Use already existing files to see the format. After the restart of plasma
you should see the new calendar.


5. Contributions
----------------------------------
Any feedback, ideas, suggestions or contributions are highly appreciated. Your support is
especially needed for internationalization and providing of additional nameday calendars.
